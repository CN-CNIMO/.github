## Overview of Team
* Each [repository](https://github.com/orgs/CN-FPA/repositories) contains 
  - all information related to the project. I.e., each repo has a modular design, and
  - detailed documentation on the front page's `README.md` file.
* You can [search **key topics** like `CMAC`](https://github.com/orgs/CN-FPA/repositories?q=CMAC&type=all&language=&sort=) to find all repositories relating to CMAC.
* Repositories with `Private Archive` tags means that they are no longer used, or archived. GitHub prevents editing within these repositories.
